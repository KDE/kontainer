New response for issue #489:

Author: Levente Polyak

Using our logo next to officially maintained images from within Arch Linux, specifically "docker.io/library/archlinux:latest" and "quay.io/toolbx/arch-toolbox:latest" is fine.

We'd just like to make sure unofficial third-party images are not confused to be official. Feel free to go ahead for the two mentioned images.
