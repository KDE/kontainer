You may use the logo in your application.

I don’t know yet to be honest. I need to investigate if we decided the exact license.

Good question. I found an email from 18 January 2019 where the author of the logo is giving the rights to me. I think you can credit it to the Alpine Linux Project.

I found a suggestion on the mailing list for the guidelines of the logo, but I dont think it was ever followed up. I think you can use that as general guidelines until we have something properly documented.
