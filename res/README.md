# kontainer-logos-trademarks

This repository documents the **trademark rights and usage permissions** for icons and logos used in the **Kontainer** project.

## Structure

All logo files are stored in the `permissions/` folder, organized into subfolders for each project or brand.

Each subfolder contains a `README.md` with the following information:

- Name and (if applicable) link to the organization/brand
- Trademark owner
- Licensing or usage terms
- Proof of permission to use the logo in Kontainer (e.g. license text, email excerpts, or public statements), when available

Example structure:
```
permissions/
├── archlinux/
│   ├── logo.svg
│   └── README.md
├── kde/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── README.md
└── ...
```

## Purpose

This repository provides a transparent and verifiable record of:

- Trademarks used in the Kontainer project
- Permissions or licenses for usage
- Sources or confirmations of usage rights

It helps ensure compliance with licensing policies and trademark law, and makes the project easier to audit or distribute.

## Disclaimer

This repository does not claim ownership of any trademarked logos or brand assets stored here.

Each logo is the property of its respective trademark holder. Usage within the Kontainer project is done in accordance with the permissions granted or publicly available trademark usage guidelines.

If you are a rights holder and believe a logo is being used inappropriately or wish it to be removed, please open an issue or contact the maintainer.
