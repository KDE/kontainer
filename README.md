# Distrobox Qt GUI (Work in Progress)

This is a **work-in-progress** graphical user interface for [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox), written in **Python with PyQt6**, designed to integrate well with **KDE on Linux**.

The goal is to provide a native, clean, and functional GUI experience for managing your Distrobox containers — including creating, cloning, updating, entering, and deleting boxes — using system-native icons and KDE aesthetics.

## Features (Planned / Stubbed)

- ✅ View all Distroboxes
- ✅ Create new boxes
- ⏳ Clone, update, enter, export apps (UI exists, functionality to be implemented)
- ❌ No full Distrobox backend bindings yet — logic stubs are in place

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6
- `distrobox` installed and working in your system environment

Install PyQt6 via pip if needed:

```bash
pip install PyQt6
